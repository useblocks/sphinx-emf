Introduction
============

`Sphinx-Needs <https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-needs>`_ was invented to manage objects in a Sphinx-Documentation.
That way Docs-as-Code becomes much more powerful. ``Sphinx-EMF`` makes it possible to import and export
`Eclipse EMF <https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/>`_ models to/from ``Sphinx-Needs``.

Usage
=====

1. Install with pip::

    pip install sphinx-emf

2. Add it to your project with poetry::

    poetry add sphinx-emf
